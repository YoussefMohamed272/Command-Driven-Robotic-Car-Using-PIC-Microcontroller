# Command-Driven-Robotic-Car-Using-PIC-Microcontroller

## Description:
Designed and developed a command-driven robotic car system using the PIC16F871 microcontroller as part of an embedded systems project. The car takes up to 10 user-defined inputs through switches (Forward, Backward, Left, Right) and executes the sequence upon confirmation via an OK button.

The project also included a comprehensive simulation using Proteus Design Suite, allowing for precise validation of circuit design and system functionality before hardware implementation.

## Key Highlights:
Programmed the PIC16F871 microcontroller to process sequential commands for motion control.
Designed and simulated the entire circuit using Proteus, ensuring system reliability and minimizing design errors.
Integrated hardware components such as switches, actuators, and power supply.
Demonstrated expertise in embedded systems, sequential logic, and simulation-based testing.


This project reflects a strong foundation in embedded systems, simulation tools, and hardware-software integration for practical robotics applications.
